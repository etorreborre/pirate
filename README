NAME
        pirate - command line 'arrrrg processor

DESCRIPTION
        Pirate is a scala library that provides a mechanism for parsing
        command line arguments and producing usage strings.

USAGE
        T.B.A.

STATE
        The `pirate` library is currently in an incubation stage and is
        considered experimental and subject to breaking change.

LIMITATIONS
        The current version does lacks built in support for a small set
        of command line styles:
          1. git style sub commands using different argument types*
          2. find style state based switching (e.g. -name abc -o -name xyz
          3. variable arity flags (e.g. -names abc xyz / -name <optional>)
          4. variable length positional parameters may only be used last

        * can be emulated without too much trouble.
