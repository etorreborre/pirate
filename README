NAME
        pirate - command line 'arrrrg processor

DESCRIPTION
        Pirate is a scala library that provides a mechanism for parsing
        command line arguments and producing usage strings.

USAGE
        Documentation is currently light on. The best place to start is
        the demos:
          . io.mth.pirate.demo.SwitchesDemo
          . io.mth.pirate.demo.PositionalArgsDemo

STATE
        The `pirate` library is currently in an incubation stage and is
        considered experimental and subject to breaking change -- the
        plan is to evolve the api until the following limitations have
        been addressed.

LIMITATIONS
        The current version does lacks built in support for a set
        of command line styles*:
          1. git style sub commands using different argument types**
          2. find style state based switching (e.g. -name abc -o -name xyz
          3. variable arity flags (e.g. -names abc xyz / -name <optional>)
          4. variable length positional parameters may only be used last
          5. flags with --flag=value syntax as well as --flag value.

        *  support is planed for these in the near future
        ** can be emulated without too much trouble.
